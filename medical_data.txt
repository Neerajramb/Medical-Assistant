What is diabetes?
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, kidney disease, and vision loss.

Symptoms of a common cold:
A common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat. Symptoms can include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, slight body aches or a mild headache, sneezing, and low-grade fever.

How to treat a common cold?
There is no cure for the common cold, but treatments can help relieve symptoms. These include rest, drinking plenty of fluids, over-the-counter pain relievers (like ibuprofen or acetaminophen), cough syrup, and saline nasal sprays. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like the common cold.

What is hypertension?
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure.

Preventing flu:
The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. Other preventative measures include washing hands frequently, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and staying home when you are sick.

What is asthma?
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Triggers can include allergens, irritants, exercise, and respiratory infections.

What is a headache?
A headache is a pain in any region of the head. Headaches can be mild, moderate, or severe.

To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids throughout the day, especially when exercising, in hot weather, or when experiencing fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Water is the best choice, but clear broths, fruit juices, and sports drinks can also help replenish electrolytes.

What is cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. However, too much bad cholesterol (LDL) can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease.

Lowering high cholesterol:
Ways to lower high cholesterol include adopting a heart-healthy diet low in saturated and trans fats, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and in some cases, taking prescribed medications like statins.

What is eczema?

What is sleep apnea?

Managing acid reflux:
Lifestyle changes can help manage acid reflux, including eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding trigger foods (like fatty foods, caffeine, chocolate, spicy foods), not lying down immediately after eating, elevating the head of your bed, and maintaining a healthy weight.

What are antibiotics?
Antibiotics are powerful medicines that fight bacterial infections. They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from growing. They are effective only against bacterial infections and do not work for viral infections like colds, flu, or most sore throats.

When to use antibiotics?
Antibiotics should only be used when prescribed by a healthcare professional for a confirmed bacterial infection. Overusing or misusing antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, making infections harder to treat in the future.

Recovery from a concussion typically involves physical and mental rest. Avoid activities that could worsen symptoms, such as strenuous exercise, screen time, and complex cognitive tasks, until symptoms subside. Follow a doctor's guidance for a gradual return to activities.

What is a stroke?
A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.

Recognizing stroke symptoms (FAST):
Remember the FAST acronym: **F**ace drooping, **A**rm weakness, **S**peech difficulty. If you see any of these signs, it's **T**ime to call emergency services immediately.
